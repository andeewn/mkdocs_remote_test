# MkDocs Remote Publishing

This repository is dedicated solely to publishing documentation from the private repository:
**[andeewn/mkdocs_test](https://github.com/andeewn/mkdocs_test)**.

## How it works
1. Content is automatically pulled from the private repository via GitHub Actions.
2. The site is built using MkDocs.
3. The resulting site is published to GitHub Pages.

*Do not edit documentation directly in this repository, as changes will be overwritten.*
